# Rotational data augmentation for Yolo

Image data augmentation is the technique that generates new transformed versions of training images from the given image dataset. This process increases dataset diversity and improves the generalization ability of the model.

One common data augmentation technique is random image rotation. Rotation is an affine transformation that is a linear mapping method that preserves the parallelism of lines.
